# LearnOpenGL

This is a repo I use to log all of the exercises / tutorials I follow on https://learnopengl.com.

I may make different tags to show the history of the repo as I follow the tutorials, or I might make separate folders. Not entirely sure yet, but if you're looking for examples you'll be able to tell in the `tags` of the repo or by the folder structure.

## OpenGL Version
In `main.cpp` it's hard coded to 4.1, so you'll probably want to change that based on your system/requirements.

## Running the project
This project was setup on Mac OS X with the CLion IDE. I've included the glfw-3.3.2 and glad dependecies in the repo so it should hopefully build with CMake straight away.

## Getting Help
I am a complete n00b when it comes to OpenGL. I'm doing this because 
1. I'm interested in graphics programming
2. I've got a lot of time in lockdown

That being said, if you want help feel free to reach out, I just can't guarantee I can help.
